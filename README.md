# mysql_cloudmanaged_databases

## Challenges:
### - My Macbook had a macOS of 12.6 but MySQL Workbench only allowed for a MacOS of 13 or higher. The issue was that every time I tried to update my laptop, it did not work. There was always some error that occured and I didn't know what was going on. It took me 12 hours for it to finally update properly after which I was finally able to download MySQL Workbench

### - I did not know that I could sign up a new project since I am on the stonybrook.edu platform so I ended up originally signing up for the trial period

### -
