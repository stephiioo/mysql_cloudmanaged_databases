# mysql_cloudmanaged_databases

## Challenges:
### - My Macbook had a macOS 12.6, but MySQL Workbench only allowed for a MacOS of 13 or higher. The issue was that every time I tried to update my laptop, it did not work. There was always some error, and I didn't know what was happening. It took me 12 hours for it to finally update properly after which I was finally able to download MySQL Workbench

### - I did not know that I could sign up for a new project since I am on the stonybrook.edu platform so I ended up originally signing up for the trial period

### - I could not reverse engineer more than once on my laptop so I had to use my friend's laptop to finish the homework. I did everything including improving the memory, and storage, updating the version of mysql workbench that I was using, and so on but nothing worked.

## For GCP, here are the instructions since I had to rerun in=t from my friend's laptop and could not take a screenshot of my original work

### step 1: choose a database named gcp_scratch_instance

### step 2: load code in a new query tab

### step 3: run each section of the code

### step 4: see the tables with:
### select *
### from (insert title here);

### step 5: click on database then click on reverse engineer

### step 6: change the connection from one-to-many to one-on-one
